# RLS Setup Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL: Your app is public - RLS must be enabled!

Follow this checklist to secure your Supabase database.

---

## Step 1: Backup Your Data (5 minutes)

Before making changes, backup your database:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard
# Go to Database ‚Üí Backups
# Create a manual backup
```

Or export critical tables:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
COPY (SELECT * FROM users) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY (SELECT * FROM categories) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;
COPY (SELECT * FROM personas) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;
```

**Status**: ‚¨ú Backup created

---

## Step 2: Prepare Existing Data (10 minutes)

Check for data issues that could cause RLS problems:

### Check for NULL created_by fields:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT
  'categories' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as null_count
FROM categories
WHERE created_by IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'topics' as table_name,
  COUNT(*)
FROM topics
WHERE created_by IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'scenarios' as table_name,
  COUNT(*)
FROM scenarios
WHERE created_by IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'personas' as table_name,
  COUNT(*)
FROM personas
WHERE created_by IS NULL;
```

### Fix NULL values:

If you have NULL created_by values, you need to fix them first:

```sql
-- Get your admin user ID first
SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE role = 'admin' LIMIT 1;

-- Replace 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID' with the actual UUID from above
-- Then run these updates:

UPDATE categories
SET created_by = 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID'
WHERE created_by IS NULL;

UPDATE topics
SET created_by = 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID'
WHERE created_by IS NULL;

UPDATE scenarios
SET created_by = 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID'
WHERE created_by IS NULL;

UPDATE personas
SET created_by = 'YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID'
WHERE created_by IS NULL;
```

### Check for NULL is_public fields:

```sql
-- Set default visibility for existing content
UPDATE categories SET is_public = true WHERE is_public IS NULL;
UPDATE topics SET is_public = true WHERE is_public IS NULL;
UPDATE scenarios SET is_public = true WHERE is_public IS NULL;
UPDATE personas SET is_public = true WHERE is_public IS NULL;
```

**Status**: ‚¨ú Data prepared

---

## Step 3: Enable RLS (2 minutes)

### Option A: All at once (RECOMMENDED)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open `setup-all-rls-policies.sql`
4. Copy entire file contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"
7. Wait for "Success" message

**Status**: ‚¨ú RLS enabled

### Option B: One table at a time

If you prefer to go slowly, run these in order:

1. ‚¨ú `setup-users-rls.sql`
2. ‚¨ú `setup-topics-rls.sql`
3. ‚¨ú `setup-scenarios-rls.sql`
4. ‚¨ú `setup-content-assignments-rls.sql`
5. ‚¨ú `setup-rubrics-rls.sql`

**Status**: ‚¨ú All scripts executed

---

## Step 4: Verify RLS is Active (5 minutes)

### Check RLS is enabled:

```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  rowsecurity,
  CASE
    WHEN rowsecurity THEN '‚úÖ Enabled'
    ELSE '‚ùå DISABLED'
  END as status
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN (
  'users', 'categories', 'topics', 'scenarios',
  'personas', 'content_assignments', 'rubrics', 'training_sessions'
)
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected**: All tables show "‚úÖ Enabled"

**Status**: ‚¨ú All tables have RLS enabled

### Count policies:

```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected counts**:
- users: 7 policies
- categories: 5 policies
- topics: 5 policies
- scenarios: 6 policies
- personas: 5 policies
- content_assignments: 6 policies
- rubrics: 10 policies
- training_sessions: 4 policies

**Status**: ‚¨ú Policy counts verified

---

## Step 5: Test Access Control (15 minutes)

### Test as Employee:

1. Create a test employee account
2. Log in as that employee
3. Verify you can:
   - ‚úÖ See your own profile
   - ‚úÖ See public categories/topics/scenarios/personas
   - ‚úÖ See content assigned to you
   - ‚úÖ Create training sessions
4. Verify you CANNOT:
   - ‚ùå See other users' profiles
   - ‚ùå See private content not assigned to you
   - ‚ùå Access admin/manager pages
   - ‚ùå Delete other users' content

**Status**: ‚¨ú Employee access tested

### Test as Manager:

1. Create a test manager account
2. Log in as that manager
3. Verify you can:
   - ‚úÖ See all user profiles
   - ‚úÖ Create assignments
   - ‚úÖ View all training sessions
   - ‚úÖ Create categories/topics/scenarios
4. Verify you can:
   - ‚úÖ Update assignments you created
   - ‚úÖ View manager dashboard

**Status**: ‚¨ú Manager access tested

### Test as Admin:

1. Log in as admin
2. Verify you can:
   - ‚úÖ See everything
   - ‚úÖ Modify user roles
   - ‚úÖ Delete users
   - ‚úÖ Manage all content
   - ‚úÖ View all assignments

**Status**: ‚¨ú Admin access tested

---

## Step 6: Monitor for Issues (Ongoing)

### Check Supabase logs:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Logs ‚Üí Database
3. Look for errors containing:
   - "permission denied"
   - "row-level security"
   - "policy"

**Status**: ‚¨ú Logs reviewed

### Monitor application errors:

Check your Vercel logs for:
- 403 Forbidden errors
- Database query failures
- User reports of missing data

**Status**: ‚¨ú Application monitored

---

## Step 7: Update Production Environment Variables (2 minutes)

Ensure your environment variables are set correctly:

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
# Verify these are set:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Status**: ‚¨ú Environment variables verified

---

## Step 8: Redeploy Application (5 minutes)

After enabling RLS, redeploy to ensure everything works:

```bash
# Trigger a new deployment in Vercel
# Or push a commit to trigger auto-deploy

git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy after RLS setup"
git push
```

**Status**: ‚¨ú Application redeployed

---

## Troubleshooting

### If users report "Permission Denied" errors:

1. Check their user role: `SELECT id, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';`
2. Verify content has proper `created_by`: `SELECT id, name, created_by FROM categories WHERE created_by IS NULL;`
3. Check assignments are correct: `SELECT * FROM content_assignments WHERE assigned_to_id = 'user_id';`

### If admin can't access data:

```sql
-- Ensure admin role is set correctly
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin@example.com';
```

### If you need to disable RLS temporarily:

```sql
-- EMERGENCY ONLY - Do not leave disabled!
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Remember to re-enable when issue is fixed
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

---

## Final Checklist

Before considering RLS setup complete:

- ‚¨ú Backup created
- ‚¨ú Existing data fixed (no NULL created_by or is_public)
- ‚¨ú All RLS policies installed
- ‚¨ú RLS verified as enabled on all tables
- ‚¨ú Policy counts verified
- ‚¨ú Employee access tested
- ‚¨ú Manager access tested
- ‚¨ú Admin access tested
- ‚¨ú Logs reviewed for errors
- ‚¨ú Application redeployed
- ‚¨ú Production monitoring active

---

## Success Criteria

Your RLS setup is successful when:

‚úÖ All tables show `rowsecurity = true`
‚úÖ Test users can only access their authorized data
‚úÖ No "permission denied" errors in logs (except for unauthorized attempts)
‚úÖ Application functions normally for all user roles
‚úÖ Database performance is acceptable

---

## Quick Reference

**Enable all RLS**: Run `setup-all-rls-policies.sql`
**Verify enabled**: `SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';`
**View policies**: `SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';`
**Fix NULL created_by**: Update with admin user ID
**Emergency disable**: `ALTER TABLE tablename DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` (temporary only!)
