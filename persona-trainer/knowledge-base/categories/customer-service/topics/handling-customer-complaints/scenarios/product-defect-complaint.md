# Product Defect Complaint

## Scenario Overview
A customer has received a defective product and is frustrated after multiple attempts to use it. They are demanding an immediate refund and expressing dissatisfaction with product quality.

## Scenario Details
The customer purchased a premium wireless headset for $149.99 two weeks ago. Since unboxing, they've experienced intermittent connectivity issues, poor sound quality, and the right earpiece has stopped working entirely. They've already attempted basic troubleshooting steps suggested on the product website but have had no success. The customer has spent several hours trying to make the product work and is now calling to demand a full refund and express their disappointment with the product quality.

## Tone

## Key Challenges

2. Rebuilding the customer's trust in the company despite their negative product experience
3. Determining if additional troubleshooting might resolve the issue or if a return is the best option
4. Managing the customer's frustration while collecting necessary information

## Successful Outcome
The customer feels heard and validated. They understand their options and the next steps in the process. Ideally, they leave the interaction with restored confidence in the company, even if they were disappointed with the product. The solution provided should be fair and align with company policies while addressing the customer's specific concerns.
